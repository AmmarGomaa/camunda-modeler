    {
      "prompt": "Well, we need to gather their personal information, assign them a company email and computer, and give them an overview of our policies and procedures.",
      "response": "Great, those are the initial steps. Let's break them down into smaller tasks. For example, to gather their personal information, you might need to ask for their name, address, phone number, and social security number. Does that sound right?"
    },
    {
      "prompt": "Yes, that's correct.",
      "response": "Okay, let's add those tasks to the process. What comes next?"
